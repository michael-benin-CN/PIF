Investition / Finanzierung
==========================

Exercise 1 (1-A2)
-----------------

What are the three main types of decision a financial manager can make?
For each decision, give a relevant example.

---

Joint Venture between Chrysler and Fiat:

- Investment: to assess the viability of the joint venture
- Finance: How to fund the joint venture
- Liquidity: management (?)

Exercise 2 (1-A3)
-----------------

Evaluate the following statement:
"Managers should not focus on the current share price
because doing so will lead to an overemphasis
on short-term profits at the expense of long-term profits."

---

- this has always been a critisicm of company managers have focused on maximizing share prices because it was linked to their persoanl remuneration
example crunch of 2008
- Some of the banks which where hardest hit had the best share price returns in the years

Exercise 3 (1A6)
----------------

Many companies view a stock market listing as an important objective.

a) Why do you think this is the case?
b) Why do you think Google listed on a stock exchange?

---

a)

- the financicial markets are one of serveral avenues through which companies can access funding
- the financial markets are massive
- cheap source of captial

b)

- Google listed on the stock market because it needed extensive funding at an acceptable price level

Exercise 4 (1-A7)
-----------------

The 2007 annual report for Anglo American plc, the world's leading global
mining company, shows that the firm had € 34.042 billion in non-current assets
and €9.962 billion in current assets. It reported € 11.480 billion in current
liabilities and € 8.665 billion in non-current liabilities. How much has the equity
of Anglo American plc worth?

---

Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = (9.662  + 34.0442) - (11.480 + 8.665) = 23.859 billion

![Bilanzübersicht](./Bilanzuebersicht.png)

Exercise 5 (1-A8)
-----------------

Anlgo American plc announces that it plans to increase its non-current assets by € 10 billion.
If the company whishes to maintain its ratio of total liabilites to quity, how much long-term debt should it use?

---

- Step 1: Determine liability/equity ratio:

    Liability / Equity = 20.145/23.856 = 0.844

- Step 2: To find the current weightings of debt and quity in the new funding, you must actually calculate a new ratio, liability/assets:

    Liability/total assets = 20.145/44.004 = 0,457799

- Step 3: The debt raised is thus:

    4.5779 billion and equity is 5.4200 billion = 10 billion

- Step 4: Check the new liabilty/equity ratio

    new level of liabilites = 24.7229 billion
    new level of equity = € 29.2810 biollion

- The new ratio is: € 24.7229 billion/29.2810 billion = 0,844 - the same as before

Exercise 6 (1-A10)
------------------

Your company has just purchased a forklift truck, and has two payment options:

(a) pay 10,00 Swedish kroner every meonth for 12 months
(b) pay 1.200.000 swedish kroner at the end of the year

Which option would you choose? Why?

---

![Payment options](./paymentOptions.png)

The payment of SEK 1,200.000 in 12 months is less because the cash flow is after the mayority of SEK 100,000 monthly payments (Assume the monthly interes rate is 1 percent)

Exercise 7 - assessing the viability of two projects (1-A11)
------------------------------------------------------------

ProjectA Has

- a 25 % chance of loosing 1,000,000,
- a 50 % chance of break even and
- a 25 % chance of making 1,0000,000 profit

ProjectB Has

- a 25 % chance of loosing 2,000,000,
- a 50 % chance of breaking even and
- a 25 % chance of making 2,000,000 profit

Which project should you choose? Why?

---

> ZWEIFELHAFT, da Projekte in der Zukunft liegen.

You would choose the less risky project because both have the same expected value. 
In this case you would choose projectA because the risk of losing and gaining money is less that in project b.

Exercise 8 (1-A14)
------------------

You suddenly own a company that is losing € 100.000 per week.
At the rate things are going the company won't have any cash left in six months to pay creditors.

What are your goals as a financial manager?
Is this consistent with what you habe read in this chapter? Explain!

---

Goals:

- Balance between the short and long term objectives.
- When the company is in trouble short term liquidity becomes more important.
- the objective of the firm will change from maximizing shareholders value to firm survival and bankrupty avoidance
- other options such as asset sell-off can also be undertaken

Exercise 9 (1-A21)
------------------

You have the following information for the British mining firm Antofagasta plc.
All figures are in € millions.

![Liabilities](./liabilities.png)

Give a brief interpretation of what you think Antofagasta plc did over the period
2003-2007. Do you think it is in a better position now than in 2003?

---

- A lot of current assets is relation to it's current liabilits and nun current assess
- furthg investigation would be needed to dertermine what is driving the increade in current asstes
- it loos as if the firm is less rsky
- Current assets could compromise of cash

Exercise 10 (2-A5)
------------------

Explain why the corporate governance of a firm sole propietorship should be differend from that for a partnership, which in turn should be different from a limited corporation.

---

- A sole propietorship does not need formal governanace structures since all
    - busineess activities are concentrated on one induvitual
    - in partnershiip semiformal corp gov structs are present such as a partnership agreement or deed
    - a limite corporation is a separate lele entity and needs corporate gov structs

Exercise 11 (2-A6)
------------------

What are the differences between a general partnership and a limited
partnership? Why do firms choose to be partnerships instead of limited
liability corporations?

---

- In a general partnership all partners agree to provide some fraction of the work and cash and to share the profits and losses.
- Each partner is liable for all of the debts of the partnership.
Limited partnerships permit some of the partners to have limited liability
(liable only to the amount of cash one has contributed to the partnership).
- Limited partnerships usually require that
    (1) at least one partner be a general partner and
    (2) the limited partners do not participate in managing the business.

Exercise 12 (2-A19)
------------------

Why would we expect managers of a corporation to pursue the objectives of
shareholders? What about bondholders? 

---

- In agency theory, the underlying contract between the principal (shareholders) and agent (management) is based on maximising the principal's wealth.
- We would expect managers to pursue the objectives of shareholders only if their interests are the same as that of the shareholders.
- This can be done through appropriate executive compensation contracts. In most situations, the shareholder and bondholder objectives will be the same.
- However, when a firm is in financial distress, these may differ and then shareholder objectives will naturally take precedence. This is why we have bond indentures.

Exercise 13 - Valuation: The One-Period Case (4-A1)
---------------------------------------------------

Would you be willing to pay € 500 today in exchange for € 525 in one year?
What would be the key considerations in answering yes or no?
Would your answer depend on who is making the promise to repay?

---

Exercise 14 - Compounding Periods (4-A3)
----------------------------------------

As you increase the length of time involved, what happens to future values?
What happens to present values?
What happens to the future value of an annuity if you increase the rate r?
What happens to the present value?

---


Exercise 15 - Calculating Future Values (4-A7)
----------------------------------------------

In the UK, every child born after 1 September 2002 receives a € 250 voucher from the government that they cannot touch until they reach the age of 18.
Assume that the growth rate o the funds is 3.5 per cent (this is what the British government suggests):

How much will your child have at the abe of 18?

Exercise 16 - Calculating present values (4-A8)
-----------------------------------------------

In 2008, British Airways had a pension liability of € 330 million.

Let's assume it must be paid in 30 years' time.

To assess the value of the firm's shares, financial analysts want to discount this
liability back to the present.

If the relevant discount rate is 5.6 per cent, what is the present value of this liability?

---

Exercise 17 - Calculating Rates of Return (4-A9)
------------------------------------------------

On 8 February 2009 John Majeski, chairman of Reading Football Club, sold the Edgar Degas bronze sculpture Petite  Danseuse de Quatorze Ans at auction for a world record price of € 13.3 million.

He bought the statue in 2004 for € 5 million. What was his annual rate of return on this sculpture?

Exercise 18 - Interest (4-A6)
-----------------------------

You work for a jewellers and have sourced a good goldsmith who is  able to sell you 100 ounces of gold for one million rand.
You approach your two main customers. Mr Martyn says he will buy the gold from you in six months for R 1,040,000, whereas Ms Kuchner tells you that she will be able to buy the gold from you in two years' time for R1,160,000.
What is the annual percentage rate that Mr Martyn and Ms Kuchner are offering you? Which option should you go for?

Exercise 19 - Perpetuities (4-A10)
----------------------------------

An investor purchasing a British consol is entitled to receive annual payments from the British government for ever.
What is the price of a consol that pays € 4 annually if the next payment occurs one year from today?
The market interest rate is 3 per cent.

Exercise 20 - Net Present Value / NPV (4-A12)
---------------------------------------------

FIFA rules regarding players contracts are very interesting.
If a player whishes to break his contract, the pruchasing club must pay the players's club four times the player's annual salary multiplied by the number of years left onb the contract.

The player must pay 10 per cent of this amount personally,
and the agent must also pay 10 per cent of the amount from his own pocket.

Consider the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, who was widely rumored to be leaving Manchester United for Real Madrid during the summer of 2008 (he acutally joined in the summer of 2009).

At the time Ronaldo was earning € 120,000 a week, and had four years of his contract with Manchester United left.

a) Calculate how much Ronaldo would have personally had to pay Manchester United if he left with 4 years remainung, 3 years remaining, 2 years remaining and 1 year remaining!
b) If the appropriate annulized discount rate is 8 per cent, what is the present value to Ronaldo of breaking his contract with 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 years remaining?
c) Assume you are Ronaldo's agent and can personally earn € 5 million today from getting  Ronaldo to sign a pre-contract agreement to join Real Madrid in the future.
d) Calculate the net present value to you if Ronaldo left with 4 years remaining, 3 years remainung, 2 years remaining and 1 year remaining.

Exercise 21 - Future Value (4-A16)
----------------------------------

What is the future value in four years of € 1,000 invested in an account stated annual interest rate of 10 per cent:

a) Compounded annually?
b) Compounded semi-annually?
c) Compounded monthly?
d) Compounded continuously?
e) Why does the future value increase as the compounding period shortens? 

---

FP = PV (1 + r)^T

a) annualy
FV = 1000 (1 + 0.1)^4 = 1,464.10 €

b) semi-annually
FV = 1000 (1  + 0.1/2)^(4*2)

c) monthly
FV = 1000 (1 + 0.1 /12)^(4 * 12)

d) continuusly

FV = PV ^(eT)

Exercise 22 - (4A18)
--------------------

a) What is the annualized interest rate, compounded daily, that is equivalent to 12
per cent interest compounded semi-annually?
b) What is the daily compounded rate that is equivalent to 12 per cent compounded continuously?

---

- semi-annually - twice a year
- quarterly - 4 times a year
- monthly - 12 times a year
- weekly - 52 times a year
- daily - 365 times a yeear
- continuous

FV = C (1 + (r / m))

---

a)

(1 + (r/365))^365 = (1 + (0.12/2))^2
(1 + (r/365))^365 = 1.1236
(1 + (r/365)) = (1.1236)^1/365
1 + r /365 = 1,000319
r= 1.000319 x 365
r = 11.6556% (11,6435 % gerundet)

b) 

(1 + (r/365))^365 = e^0.13 = 1.127497
(1 + (r/365)) = 1.12^1/365
1 + r/365 = 1.000329
r = 0.00329 + 365
r = 12.002 %

Antwortsatz: "Der Zinsatz, der täglich gezahlt wird und dabei den kontinuierlichen Zinsatz (12%) entspricht müsste bei 12,002 % liegen." - Tutor

Exercise 23 - Growing Perpetuities (C4E19)
------------------------------------------

Marcus Boruc has been working on a new hands-free telephone that clips into your ear.
The new gadget has now been cleared for manufacture and development.
Marcus anticipates his first annual cash flow from the phone to be €200,000, received two years from today.
Subsequent annual cash flows will grow at 5 per cent in perpetuity.
What is the present value of the phone if the discount rate is 10 per cent?

---

Perpetuity: A constant stream of cash flows that never ends

PV of a growing perpetuitiy: PV = C/(r-g)

Where g is the *perpetual growth rate*

---

PV  = (C / (r - g)), however Marc receives two years from today, therefore
PV  = (C / (r - g)) * (1 / (1 + r))
    = (200.000 €/ (0,1 - 0,05)) * ( / (1 + 0,1))
    = 3,636,363.64 €

Exercise 24 - Calculating Interest Expense (4A21)
-------------------------------------------------

You receive a credit card application from Shady Banks plc offering an introductory rate of 1.90 per cent per year, compounded monthly for the first six
months, increasing thereafter to 16 per cent per year compounded monthly.

Assuming you transfer the €4,000 balance from your existing credit card
and make no subsequent payments,
how much interest will you owe at the end of the first year?

---

Here we need to find the FV of lump sum, with a changing interest rate. We must solve this problem in two parts. After the first six months, the balance will be:

FV = € 4000 [1+ (.019/12)]^6 = 4038,15 €

This is the blance in six months. The FV in another six months will be:

FV = 4038.15 [1 + (.16/12)]^6  = 4372,16 €

The problem asks fpor interest accured, so , to find the interes, we substract the beginning balance from the FV. The interst accured is:

Interest = 4372.16 € - 4000.00 € = 372.16 €

Exercise 25 - Ballon Payments (A422)
------------------------------------

Mario Guiglini has just sold his hotel
and purchased a restaurant with the proceeds.
The cost of the restaurant to Mario is €500,000 and
the seller requires a 25 per cent up-front payment.
Mario is able to pay the up-front payment from the proceeds of the hotel sale.
He needs to take out a mortgage and
has been able to arrange one with Unicredit Bank that charges a 9 per cent APR.
Mario will make equal monthly payments over the next 30 years.
His first payment will be due one month from now.
However, the mortgage has an eight-year-balloon payment option, meaning that the
balance of the loan could be paid off at the end of year 8.
There were no other transaction costs or finance charges.
How much will Mario's balloon payment be in eight years?

---

Anniuity: A level stream of cash flows that last for a fixed number periods

PV of an anninuity: PV = C [1/r - (1 / (r (1 + r)^T))] = C[((1-(1/1+r) / r))]

The last term in the brackets is called the Anniuity factor, A^T_p

---

> (Anzahlung: 500,000 € * 25 % = 125,000 €)

The amount borrows is the value of the restaurant times one minus the down payment, or:

Amount borrowed = 500,000 € (1- .25) = 275.000 €

the mothly payments woth ballon payment loab are calculated assuming a longer amortisation schedule, in theis case, 30 years. The payments based on a 30-Year repayment schedule would be:

PVA = 375,000 € = C ({1 - [1/ (1 + 0.09/ 12)]^360} / (0.09 / 12))

C = 2922.96 €

Now (at time = 8) we need to find the PV of the payments which have not been made. The ballon payment wil lbe:

PVA = 2922.96 € * ((1 - (1 / (1 + 0.09/12))^(22*12)) / (0.09/12))
PVA = 344657,65 €

Alpha: 335500 €

Nachgereichte Ergebnisse:

> C = 2.017,3348 €
> PVA = 346.352.59 €

Exercise 26 - Annuities (4A26)
------------------------------

Today, you have become a new mother
and the British government has given you €250 for your child's trust fund.
You think it would be a great idea to use this as the basis for saving for your child's future.
You believe in private schooling and so
you want to put aside a certain amount each year to pay for your child's

- primary schooling (ages 5-11),
- secondary schooling (ages 12-17) and
- university tuition (ages 18-22).

Private primary schooling costs €7,000 per year and private secondary schooling costs €8,000 per year.

If your child gets into university, the fees and maintenance will be in the region of € 15,000 per year.

Your child will start school five years from now, and you plan to deposit money every year in the trust fund, starting one year from now.
The annual percentage rate you've been quoted by the government is 6.5 per cent.
How much money must your deposit in an account each year to fund your
child's education?
You will make your last deposit when your child enters university.

---

250 € once
annualy deposit sarting one year from now

---

private schooling costs:
primary school  (5 - 11)    7000 €/year
secondary school    (12 - 17)   8000 €/year
university tuitition    (18 - 22)   15000€/year

Step 1 Calculate the present calue of primary schopoliing, seconary schooling and university tuition the year before the actitiey starts.

a)  Primary schooling (7 years)
PV  = C x A^7_0.065
    = 7000 € * A^7_0.065
    = 38391.64 €

b)  Secondary schooling (6 years)
PV  = C * A^6_0.065
    = 

c)  university tuition ()

Step 2 Calculate the present valuze of t primary schooling, secondary schooling and universiyty tuitiopn.

a)  Primary Schooling
PV  = 38391,64 / (1.065)^4
    = 29842,71 €

b)  Secpndary schooling
PV  = 38728,11 / (1.065)^11
    = 19372,27 €

c)  University schooling
PV  = 51386.98 / (1.065)^17
    = 17616.10 €

Present value of all payments = 29842,71 € + 19372.27 + 17616.10 = 66831.08

Since you already have 350 € from the government, the amount you need to inest is 66831.08 - 250 € = 66581.08

PV  = C ((1/r) - (1 / (r * (1 + r) ^ T)))  = 66581.08 €
    = C (1 / 0.065 - 1 / (0.065 * (1.065^18)))
C   = 6382.10 €

Exercise 27 - Definition of a bond (5A1)
----------------------------------------

What are the main characteristics of a bond? Provide examples of different
types of bond in terms of coupons, maturity and face value.

---

- The face value or principal
- The term to maturity
- The coupon rate and
- The frequency of coupon payments.

A zero coupon bond has no coupon and only pays the face vale at expiry.

A coupon bind can have a fixed coupon where coupon payments are fixed for the life if a bond or a floating coupon where payments are based on some benchmark such as LIBOR or EURIBOR.

Exercise 28 - ?!

Exercise 29 - Valuing Bond (5A10)
---------------------------------

In March 2009 the German freight company Deutsche
Bahn issued a 10-year bond with face value of € 1,000 and
paying an annual coupon of 4.875 per cent. What is the
price of the bond if the yield to maturity (YTM) is

a) 4 per cent?
b) 5 per cent?
c) 10 per cent?

> Yield to maturity = Rückzahlungsrendite

If the yield to maturity for a bond is less than the bond's
coupon rate, then the (clean) market value of the bond is
greater than the par value (and vice versa).
If a bond's coupon rate is less than its YTM, then the bond
is selling at a discount.
If a bond's coupon rate is more than its YTM, then the
bond is selling at a premium.
If a bond's coupon rate is equal to its YTM, then the bond
is selling at par.

---

PV = C * A^T_r + F / (1 + r)^T

Where A^T_r is the annuity factor for an annuitiy of 1 € per period for T periods at an interest rate per period of r.

A^T_r = C * [ (1 - (1 / (1 + r)^T) / r) ]

---

PV = C * A^T_r + (F)/(1+r)^T

where A^T_r is the annuity factor for an annuity of 1 € per period for T periods at an interest rate per period of r.

A^T_r = C [(1 - (1)/(1+r)^T)/(r)]

P = 48,75 * [(1 - (1)/(1 + 0,04)^10)/(0,04)] + (1000)/(1,04)^10 = 1070,97

a)

P = € 48,75 x * A^10_0.04 + 1000 / 1.04)^10
P = € 1070,97

b)

P = € 48.75 * A^10_0.05 + 1000 / (1.05)^10
P = € 990,35

c)

P = 
P = € 685,09

Exercise 30 - Share Values (5A12)
---------------------------------

In 2009 DaimlerChrysler had just paid a dividend
of €2 per share on its equity. The dividends are
expected to grow at a constant rate of 5 per cent
per year indefinitely.
If investors require a 11 per cent return on
DaimlerChrysler's equity, what is the current
price?
What will the price be in three years? In 15 years?

---

Zero growth: P_0 = D_1 / r

Constant grwoth: P_0 = D_1 / (r - g)

---

Zero growth: P_0 = (D_1)/(r)
Constant growth: P_0 = (D_1)/(r - g)

Current price at a constant growth of 5 percent per year indefinitely:

P = Div_1 / (r - g), whereas Div_1 = D_0 (1 + g)
i.e. Div_1 = 2 (1.05) = € 2.1

P = € 2.1 / (0.11 - 0.05) = 35 €

                                                                    P_0 -> Div_1
Price in 3 years:
    P_3  = P_0(1 + g)3 = 35 € * (1.05)^3 = € 40.52

Price in 15 years:
    P_15 = P_0 (1 + g)^15 = € 35 * (1.05)^15 = 72.76 €

Exercise 31 - Share Values (5A13)
---------------------------------

The next dividend payment from French health food firm Danone will be
€ 1.12 per share. The dividends are anticipated to maintain a 5 per cent
growth rate for ever. If Danone shares currently sell for €35.00, what is the
required return?

---

Zero growth: P_0 = D_1 / r

Constant grwoth: P_0 = D_1 / (r - g)

---

Zero growth: P_0 = (D_1)/(r)
Constant growth: P_0 = (D_1)/(r - g)

Äquivalenzumformung:

P_0 = (D_1)/(r - g)     | * (r - g)
P_0 * (r - g) = (D_1)   | / P_0
r - g = (D_1)/ P_0      | + g
r = (D_1)/ P_0 + g

                                                                Div_1 = D_1, R = r
=> R = 1,12 / 35 + 0,05 = 8,2 %

Exercise 33 - Bond Return (5A18)
--------------------------------

A six-year government bond makes annual coupon payments of
5 per cent and offers a yield of 3 per cent annually compounded. Suppose
that one year later the bond still yields 3 per cent.

What return has the bondholder earned over the 12-month period?

Now suppose that the bond yields 2 per cent at the end of the year. What
return would the bondholder earn in this case?

---

PV = C * A^T_r + F / (1 + r)^T

Where A^T_r is the annuity factor for an annuitiy of 1 € per period for T periods at an interest rate per period of r.

A^T_r = C * [ (1 - (1 / (1 + r)^T) / r) ]

The return on the bond is [(P_1 + C) / P_0] - 1

---

PV = C * A^T_r + (F)/(1+r)^T

where A^T_r is the annuity factor for an annuity of 1 € per period for T periods at an interest rate per period of r.

A^T_r = C [(1 - (1)/(1+r)^T)/(r)]

a)

P   = 50 * [(1 - (1)/(1 + 0,03)^6))/(0,03)] + 1000 / 1,03^6 = 1.108,34
P_1 = 50 * [(1 - (1)/(1 + 0,03)^5))/(0,03)] + 1000 / 1,03^5 = 1.091,59
...
P_2 =                        4                                       4

If yields fall to 2 %:

P = 50 * A^5_0.03 + 1000 / 1+R^5 ???

The return on the bond is
    [(P_1 + C)/(P_0)] - 1

After one year, the return is:
    [(1,091.59 + 50) / 1,108.34] - 1 = 3 %

In the second example, the return is:
    [(1,141.40 + 50) / 1,108.34] - 1 = 7.49 %

Exercise 34 - Non-Constant Growth (5A19)
----------------------------------------

Dylan Bearings is a young start-up company.
No dividends will be paid on the shares over the next nine years because the firm needs to plough back its earnings to fuel growth.
The company will pay an € 8 per share dividend in 10 years and will increase the dividend by 6 per cent per year thereafter.
If the required return is 13 per cent, what is the current share price?

---

Here we have an equity that pays no dividends for 10 years Once tit begins paying dividends it will have a constant growth rate of dividends.

We can use the constant growth model at that point. It is important to remember that general form of the constant dividend growth formula is:

P_t = [D_t * (1 + g)]/(R - g)

This means that since we will use the dividend in Year 10, we will be finding the share price in Year 9. The dividend growth model is similar to the PVA and the PV of a perpetuity:

The equation gives you the PV one period before the first payment. So, the price of the equity in year 9 will be:

P_9 = D_10 / (R - g)
    = € 8.00 / (0.13 - 0.06) = € 114.29

The price of the share today is simply the PV of the share price in the future. We simply discound the future share price at the required return.

The price of the share today will be:
    P_0 = €114.29 / 1.13 ^9 = € 38.04

Exercise 35 - Calculating Payback Period and NPV (6A9)
------------------------------------------------------

Hideoshi Software has the following mutually exclusive projects.

![mutually exclusive projects](Exercise_35_-_mutuallyExclusiveProjects.png)

a) Suppose Hideoshi’s payback period cut-off is two years. Which of these two projects should be chosen?

b) Suppose Hideoshi uses the NPV rule to rank these two projects.
Which project should be chosen if the appropriate discount rate is 10 per cent?

---

a) The paybay period is the  time that it takes for the cumlative undiscounted sach inflows to eqyual the initel incest ment.

ProjectA

Cumulative cash flows year 1: €4000 = €4000
Cumulative cash flows year 2: €4000 + 5500€ = 9500 € > 5500€
The payback period is les than the 2 year cut-off and so project a would be accepted.

ProjectB

Cumulative cash flows year 1: €2500 = €2500
Cumulative cash flows year 2: €2500 + 1200€ = 3700 €
Cumulative cash flows year 2: €2500 + 1200€ + 3000€ = 3700 € > 4000€
The payback period is greater than the 2 year cut-off and so project B would not be accepted.

b) Discount each project's cash flows at 10 percent. Choose the project with the highest NPV.

ProjectA:
    NPV = -€5500 + €4000/1.10 + 5500€/1.10^2 + 500€/1.10^3
    NPV = 3057.48 €

ProjectB:
    NPV = -4000€ + 2500€/1.10 + 1200/1.10^2 + 3000/1.10^3
    NPV = 1518,407 €

The firm should choose Project A since it has a higher NPV than Project B has.

Interpolation zur Bestimmung des Amotisierungszeitraum
------------------------------------------------------

Companies can calculate a more precise value using fractional years.
To calculate the fractional payback period, find the fraction of year 2’s cash
flows that is needed for the company to have cumulative undiscounted
cash flows of €5,000.
Divide the difference between the initial investment and the
cumulative undiscounted cash flows as of year 2 by the undiscounted cash
flow of year 2.
 
Payback period = 1 + (€5,500 – €4,000) / €5,500
Payback period = 1.27

Exercise 36 - Calculating discounted Payback (6A11)
----------------------------------------------------

An Investment project has annual cash inflows of € 7.000, € 7.500, € 8.000 and
€ 8.500 and a discount rate of 10 per cent.
What is the discounted payback period for these cash flows if the initial cost is € 8.000?
What if the initial cost is € 13.000? What if it is € 18.000?

---

Idee: (8000 + 7000 ) / 1.10 + etc.

When we use the discounted payback, we need to find the value of all cash flows today.

The value today of the project cash flows for the first 4 years is:

Value today of year 1 cash flow = 7000/1.10^1 = 6363,64 €
Value today of year 1 cash flow = 7500/1.10^2 = 6198,35 €
Value today of year 1 cash flow = 8000/1.10^3 = 6010,52 €
Value today of year 1 cash flow = 8500/1.10^4 = 5805,61 €

Payback period = 1 + (8000 - 6363,64)/6198,35 € = 1,?

To find the discounted payback, we use these values to find the payback period.

The discounted first year cash flow is 6363,64 €, so the discounted payback for an 8000 € initial cost is:
Discounted payback = 1 + (€8000 - 6363,64)/6198,35 = 1.26 years

for an initial cost of 13000€ initial cost of 13000 the discounted payback is:

Discounted payback = 2 + (18000 - 6363.64 - 6198,35) / 6010,52 € = 2.90 years

Exercise 37 - Average Accounting Return (AAR) (6A13)
----------------------------------------------------

Bluerock Group has invested € 8000 in a high-tech project lasting 3 years.

Deprecation (= Abschreibung) is € 4000, € 2500 and € 1500 in year 1,2 and 3 respectiviely.
The project generate pre-tax income of € 2000 each year.

The pre-tax income already includes the deprecation expense.
If the tax rate is 25 % what is the projects average accounting return (AAR)?

---

**First**, we need to determine the average book value of the project.
The book value is the gross investment minus accumulated depreciation.

                                    Purchase date   Year I  Year II Year III
    Gross Investment                8000 €          8000 €  8000 €  8000 €
    Less accumulated depreciation   0 €             4000 €  6500 €  8000 €
    = net investment                8000 €          4000 €  1500 €  0€

**Second**,Now we can calculate the average book value as:

Average book value = (8000 € + 4000 €+ 1500 € + 0 €) / 4 (years) = 3,375 €

> Tipp: Selber noch mal googlen, wenig informationen zu dieser angelsächsischen Variante vorhanden,

To calculate the average accounting return, wqe must rememeber to use the aftertax average net oncome when calculating the aerage accounting return. So the aerage aftertay income is:

Average aftertax net income = (1 - t_c) Annual pretay net income
Average aftertax net income = (1 - 0.25) € 2000
Average aftertax net income = 1500 €

The average accouhting return is the average after-tax net income divided by the average book value, which is:

Average accounting return = 1500 € / 3,375 €
Average accounting return = 0.4444 or 44.44 %

Exercise 38 - Calculating IRR (6A14)
------------------------------------

Calculate the NPV of the following project
for discount rates of 0, 50 and 100 per cent.
What is the IRR of the project?

    Year            0       1       2
    Cash Flow       € -7000 € 5000  €20000
    
---

/* Einzelarbeit */

NpV = -7000 + 5000/(1 + 0) + 20000/(1 + 0)^2) = 18000 €
NpV = -7000 + 5000/(1 + 0.5) + 20000/(1 + 0.5)^2) = 5222,22 €
NpV = -7000 + 5000/(1 + 1) + 20000/(1 + 1)^2) = 500 €

The IRR is equal to:

NPV = 0 = -7000 + 5000 €/(1 + IRR)^1 + 20000/(1 + IRR)^2

Thorough trial and error or solver in an excel spreadsheet, IRR is equal to 108.48 %.

Exercise 39 - Problems with the IRR (6A6)
-----------------------------------------

Review the main problems that arise when one uses
only IRR to evaluate potential projects.

---

There are several issues the analyst must consider when using IRR to value investments:

- First they must consider whether a collection of candidate projects are mutually exclusive ad/or independent.
- Secondly, it is not possible to compare projects if the scale of their investments are different. Therefore a small scale project may have a high IRR but increase the wealtg by very little ind absolute terms.
- Thirdly, one must be careful when using IRR for projects that require investment or borrowing.
- Fourthly, if the cash flows from the project change sind more than once the it is very likely that the project will have more than one IRR value.

Exercise 40 - Calculating Profitability Index (6A17)
----------------------------------------------------

Suppose the following two independent investment opportunities are available to Greenplain Ltd.
The appropriate discount rate is 10 per cent.

    Year    Project Alpha (€)   Project Beta (€)
    0       -500                -2.000
    1       300                 300
    2       700                 1.800
    3       600                 1.700

a) Compute the profitability index for each of the two projects.
b) Which project(s) should Greenplain accept,
based on the profitability index rule?

---

a) The profitability index is the present value of the future cash flows devided by he inital cost.
So for Project Alpham the profitiblility index is:

$PI_{alpha} = [300 \text{\euro} /1.10 + 700 \text{\euro} / 1.10^2 + 600 \text{\euro}/1.10^3]/ 500\text{\euro} = 2.604$

And for Project Beta the Profitability index is:

$PI_{Beta} = [300€ / 1.10 + 1800 €/1.10^2 + 1700€/1.10^3] / 2000 € = 1.519$

b) According to the PI, you would accept Project Alpha.
However, remember the profitability index rule can lead to an incorrrect decision when rannking mutually exlusive projects.

Exercise 41 - Comparing Investment Criteria (6A24)
--------------------------------------------------

The treasurer of Amaro Canned Fruits has projected the cash flows of projects A, B and C as follows:

    Year    Project A (€)   Project B (€)   Project C (€)
    0       -100.000        -200.000        -100.000
    1       70.000          130.000         75.000
    2       70.000          60.000          130.000
    
Suppose the relevant discount 12 per cent per rate is year.

a) Compute the profitability index for each of the three projects.
b) Compute the NPV for each of the three projects.
c) Suppose these three projects are independent.
Which project(s) should Amaro accept, based on the profitability index rule?
d) Suppose these projects are mutually exclusive.
Which project(s) should Amaro accept, based on the profitability index rule?
e) Suppose Amaro’s budget for these projects is €300.000.
The projects are not dividable. Which project(s) should Amaro accept?

---
a) Profitability indexes

PI_ProjectA = [70.000/1.12 + 70.000/1.12^2 ] /  100.000 € = 1.18
PI_ProjectB = [130.000/1.12 + 130.000/1.12^2] / € = 1.10
PI_ProjectC = [75.000/1.12 + 60.000/1.12^2] / € = 1.15

b) Net Present Value

NPV_a = -100.000 + 70.000/1.12 + 70.000 / 1.12 + 70.000 / 1.12^2 = 18803.57
NPV_b =  190
NPV_c = 14095,92

c) Accept projects A, B, and C. Since the projects are independent, accept all three
projects because the respective profitability index of each is greater than one.

> Man kann jedes Projekt nehmen, weil ihre Indizes alle größer Null und sie daher profitabel sind.

d) Accept Project B. Since the Projects are mutually exclusive, choose the Project with
the highest PI, while taking into account the scale of the Project. Because Projects A
and C have the same initial investment, the problem of scale does not arise when
comparing the profitability indices. Based on the profitability index rule, Project C can
be eliminated because its PI is less than the PI of Project A. Because of the problem of
scale, we cannot compare the PIs of Projects A and B. However, we can calculate the
PI of the incremental cash flows of the two projects, which are:

Project     C0          C1      C2
B-A         -€100,000   €60,000 €60,000

d) When calculating incremental cash flows, remember to subtract
the cash flows of the project with the smaller initial cash outflow from
those of the project with the larger initial cash outflow. This procedure
insures that the incremental initial cash outflow will be negative. The
incremental PI calculation is:
 
PI(B – A) = [€60,000 / 1.12 + €60,000 / 1.122] / €100,000
PI(B – A) = 1.014
 
The company should accept Project B since the PI of the
incremental cash flows is greater than one.

e) Remember that the NPV is additive across projects. Since we can spend 300.000 € we could take two of the projects. in this case we would take the two projects wih the highest NPVs which are Prject B and PRoject A.

Sparkling Water Plc expects to sell 2 Million bottles
of drinking water each year in perpetuity. This year
each bottle will sell for £1.25 in real terms and will
cost £0.70 in real terms. Sales income and costs
occur at year-end. Revenues will rise at a real rate of 7
per cent annually, while real costs will rise at a real
rate of 5 per cent annually. The real discount rate is 10
per cent. The corporate tax rate is 28 per cent. What is
Sparkling worth today?

To determine the value of a firm, we can simply find the present
value of the firm’s future cash flows. No depreciation is given, so we
can assume depreciation is zero. Using the tax shield approach, we
can find the present value of the aftertax revenues, and the present
value of the aftertax costs. The required return, growth rates, price, and
costs are all given in real terms. Subtracting the costs from the
revenues will give us the value of the firm’s cash flows. We must
calculate the present value of each separately since each is growing at
a different rate. First, we will find the present value of the revenues. The
revenues in year 1 will be the number of bottles sold, times the price
per bottle, or:

Aftertax revenue in year 1 in real terms = (2.000.000 x 1.25 €)(1 - 0.28)
Aftertax revenue in year 1 in real terms = 1.800.000 €

Exercise 44 - Equivalent Annual Cost (7A19)
-------------------------------------------

Bridgton Golf Academy is evaluating different golf
equipment. The “Dimple-Max” equipment costs
£45,000, has a three-year life and costs £5,000 per
year to operate. The relevant discount rate is 12 per
cent. Assume that the reducing balance (20 per cent)
depreciation method is used. Furthermore, assume
the equipment has a salvage value of £20,000 at the
end of the project’s life. The relevant tax rate is 28
per cent. All cash flows occur at the end of the year.
What is the equivalent annual cost (EAC) of this
equipment?

---

To calculate the EAC of an investment, first
calculate the depreciation schedule.

Revenues will grow at seven pervet per year in real terms foreeer allty grwoing operteuity fomula, we find the present calue of the revenues ois:

PV of revenues ? C_1/(R-g)

The real aftertex costs in year 1 will be:
 Aftertax in year 1 in real terms = 2000 * 0,7 €) (1 - 0.28) = 1.008.000 €

- Zahlungen gleich für bestimmte Zeit (Jede Zahlung einzeln abzinsen, Abzinsungsformel, Barwertfaktor)
- Zahlungen jedes mal anders (jeden faktor einzeln abzinsen)

Costs will grow at five percent per year in real terms forever. applying the growing oertuity formula, we find the present value of the costs is

PV_costs = C_1(R-G) = 1008000€/ (0.10 - 0,05) = 20160000

Now we can find the value of the firm, which is:

Value_firm = PV of revenues - PV of costs = 60000000 € - 20160000 € = 39840000 €
